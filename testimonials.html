				<p>"It was an eye-opening experience for us and our children to realize how blessed we are to be born healthy. We will make sure to visit this school in our every visit to India to instill humbleness in our kids and expose them to a special world apart from the fortunate contented life they are gifted."</p>

				<p>"Words fail to express some feelings. It is true in my case. I am a mother of two kids. One boy is normal and perfect in all manners. The other one is a girl. She is an autistic kid and suffering from moyamoya disease too, a chronic one in terms of cure. I left my lucrative job just to take care of her. We have been going through tough times and imagine we are in attendance to her care 24/7. In such a situation a call came from Sri. Molakalmuru Sreenivasamurthy that our daughter should be sent to his Mahavana School for special education. Believe me, the past six months my daughter is going to school and spends 8 hours in a day there and those 8 hours have become precious both to me and to my daughter. She learns at school and we spend quality time at home peacefully. Mahavana school is a godsend boon for parents like us. My daughter is learning and growing; myself and my husband are learning how to grow a child like ours. Here, I fail to express in words my gratefulness to the organization run by our own man from our own town. There are many parents like me in this region who have sent their children to special school and are highly relieved. Sir, we are with you."</p>

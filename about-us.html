					<h2>Our History</h2>
					<p>Namma Ashrama is a charitable Trust (registered on 16th August, 2022) established by Molakalmuru Sreenivasamurthy, a Buddhist scholar, to realize the tenets of Dhamma through practice. A group of selfless individuals joined him in serving the society through various means. Namma Ashrama, this title in Kannada, gives the meaning of inclusiveness of everyone in the society and one becomes part of the organization, moment this title is uttered by mouth.</p>

					<h2>Our Activities</h2>
					<p>Ashrama has been conducting Satsangs by way of teaching Yoga and Meditation (spiritual retreats) on Sunday mornings to rejuvenate the mind and body. Satsangs are held both at Molakalmuru and Bengaluru. Ashrama has organized camps for the parents of disabled children to educate them to send their children to special schools for the better future of their wards. Ashrama volunteers have conducted surveys in villages around Molakalmuru taluk to bring disabled children into the network of special education.</p>

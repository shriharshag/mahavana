				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<div class="section">
					<h2>Our Mission</h2>
					<p>Mahavana Residential School for Children with Intellectual Disabilities is managed by Namma Ashrama, a registered Trust, with the aim of educating and improving the lives of intellectually disabled children.</p>
					
					<p>A home of hope for children with special needs. Transforming challenges into chances every single day, because every child deserves a place to belong.</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h2>Our History</h2>
					<p>Namma Ashrama is a charitable Trust (registered on 16th August, 2022) established by Molakalmuru Sreenivasamurthy, a Buddhist scholar, to realize the tenets of Dharma through practice. A group of selfless individuals joined him in serving the society through various means. Namma Ashrama, this title in Kannada, gives the meaning of inclusiveness of everyone in the society and one becomes part of the organization, moment this title is uttered by mouth.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h2>Our Activities</h2>
					<p>Ashrama has been conducting Satsangs by way of teaching Yoga and Meditation (spiritual retreats) on Sunday mornings to rejuvenate the mind and body. Satsangs are held both at Molakalmuru and Bengaluru. Ashrama has organized camps for the parents of disabled children to educate them to send their children to special schools for the better future of their wards. Ashrama volunteers have conducted surveys in villages around Molakalmuru town to bring disabled children into the network of special education.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h2>Mahavana Residential School</h2>
					<p>Namma Ashrama inaugurated its ambitious Mahavana Residential School for Children with Intellectual Disabilities on 27th May, 2023, and the school started functioning from 1st June, 2023 in a rented building with five children. It is now a fully functioning institution in its own building in Shubhodayanagar at Hanagal. Namma Ashrama, through its Mahavana school, works relentlessly to get the children a comfortable life by providing food, accommodation, and education. Our main aim is to empower children and enable them to transform their lives with hands-on education and training programs.</p>

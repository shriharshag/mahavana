            <h2>About Our School</h2>
            <p>Mahavana Residential School for Children with Intellectual Disabilities is a village-based institution aimed at empowering children with disabilities between 6 and 16 years of age. This school was started in June 2023 in a rented building in Molakalmuru town and shifted its operations to its own new building in Shubodayanagar at Hanagal in Chitradurga District in June 2024. We believe that all children, including those with intellectual disabilities, deserve a fair chance at life. Our residential school shelters, feeds, and nurtures young children who need special attention and care. All our services are free, and we do not collect any fee or deposit for the services we render. Voluntary donations from anyone are welcome.</p>
